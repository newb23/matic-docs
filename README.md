## Archiving Repository

Polygon Wiki is moved from `matic-docs` to the new `wiki` repo under Polygon organization. You can check out the new repository [here](https://github.com/0xPolygon/wiki).

We recommend contributors to migrate their forks and ⭐️ the new repository. For instructions on how to contribute to the `wiki` repo, check out the [README](https://github.com/0xPolygon/wiki/blob/main/README.md) file.

`matic-docs` will remain available as a read-only repository.
