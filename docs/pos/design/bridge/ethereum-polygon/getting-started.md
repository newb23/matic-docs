Polygon brings you a trustless two-way transaction channel between Polygon PoS and Ethereum by introducing the cross-chain bridge. With this users can transfer tokens across Polygon PoS without incurring third-party risks and market liquidity limitations. **The PoS Bridge is available on both Mumbai Testnet as well as Polygon PoS Mainnet**. You can bridge assets to Polygon PoS using the [Polygon Wallet Suite](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/deposit).

Polygon also offers the **zkEVM Bridge** which can also be used via the [Polygon Wallet Suite](https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge/deposit). Read more about the zkEVM Bridge [here](https://zkevm.polygon.technology/docs/protocol/zkevm-bridge.md). This document is more about the Polygon PoS Bridge.

**Polygon PoS bridge provides a bridging mechanism that is near-instant, low-cost, and quite flexible**.

**There is no change to the circulating supply of your token when it crosses the bridge**;

- Tokens that leave the Ethereum network are locked and the same number of tokens are minted on Polygon PoS as a pegged token (1:1).
- To move the tokens back to the Ethereum network, tokens are burned on Polygon PoS network and unlocked on Ethereum network during the process.
