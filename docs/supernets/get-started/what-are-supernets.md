## Introduction

Supernets are application-specific chains that operate on the Polygons Edge consensus client with [PolyBFT consensus](/docs/supernets/design/consensus/polybft/overview.md). They leverage a [native bridge](/docs/supernets/design/bridge/overview.md) to connect with an associated rootchain, enabling them to inherit its security and capabilities. Additionally, Supernets extend the block space available on the rootchain, providing scalability and interoperability for decentralized applications. With on-chain governance mechanisms, Supernets empower communities to make decisions and upgrade the network in a transparent and compliant manner.

The following table offers a comprehensive overview on what Supernets are through different perspectives.
